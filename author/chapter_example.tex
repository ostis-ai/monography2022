\label{sec:1}
Use the template \emph{chapter.tex} together with the document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content conformable to the Springer Nature layout.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects.}.
\begin{eqnarray}
\left|\nabla U_{\alpha}^{\mu}(y)\right| &\le&\frac1{d-\alpha}\int
\left|\nabla\frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha}}\right|\,d\mu(\xi) =
\int \frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha+1}} \,d\mu(\xi)\qquad  \\
&=&(d-\alpha+1) \int\limits_{d(y)}^\infty
\frac{\mu(B(y,r))}{r^{d-\alpha+2}}\,dr \le (d-\alpha+1)
\int\limits_{d(y)}^\infty \frac{r^{d-\alpha}}{r^{d-\alpha+2}}\,dr

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
